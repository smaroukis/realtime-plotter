Project Specs
- outdoor sensor
	- wireless / wifi or bluetooth (can go directly to another device)
	- temperature sensor
	- rain sensor? 
	- solar powered
	- air quality? 
- indoor display
	- would be nice to eventually control the lights and air filter from here (IR hacking)
	- could also add a cheap hepa filter to the bathroom, add timers

What do I need right now?
- a timer for the hepa filter

Steps
1. Get MQTT on edge device (e.g. wifi enabled arduino)
2. Setup RasPi local Server 
	- OS: node-red, home-assistant
	- as a MQTT broker - e.g. with Mosquitto
	- DB: influx-db (MQTT publishes to influx-db through node-red)
	- Graphical: Grafana, etc.
3. Compile C on edge device to send temperature data to the MQTT broker
4. Add a home controller

ESPHome is a _tool_ which aims to make managing your ESP boards as simple as possible. It reads in a YAML configuration file and creates custom firmware which it installs on your ESP device. Devices or sensors added in ESPHome’s configuration will automatically show up in Home Assistant’s UI.

### MQTT
- [MQTT](MQTT.md)
- Adafruit has their own MQTT broker - cloud hosted, free - https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-in-circuitpython/connecting-to-the-adafruit-io-mqtt-broker
	- https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library 
- Mosquitto is popular for local and edge networks
